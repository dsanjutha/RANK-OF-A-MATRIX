# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: start th program.
### Step 2:import the numpy library and define the matrix a. 
### Step 3: compute the rank of the matrix using matrix_rank() function.
### Step 4: display the rank and stop the progarm.
## Program:
```python
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: D.sanjutha
#RegisterNumber:212225240136
#the number of linearly  independent rows or columns in a matrix is known as its rank
import numpy as np
a=[[1,2,3],[3,6,9]]
rank=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(rank)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
